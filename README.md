# E2504_bachelor

## Overview

This repository contains the code, models, and resources for the E2504 Bachelor project at NTNU. The project involves 3D printing, object detection using YOLOv8, and tracking with DeepSort, with integration for camera gimbal control.

## Repository Structure

- **3D-Printing/**  
  Contains 3MF and SolidWorks (SLD) files for 3D-printed components.

- **Docker/**  
  Docker resources for building and running the project environment.

- **Models/**  
  Pre-trained YOLOv8 models (`.pt` and `.engine` files) and scripts for model conversion.
  - `ConvertToTensorRT.py`: Script to convert PyTorch models to TensorRT.
  - `Training/`: Training scripts and resources.

- **Programfiles/**  
  Main Python scripts for detection, tracking, and camera/gimbal integration.
  - `Yolo.py`: Basic YOLOv8 inference.
  - `Yolo_DeepSort.py`: YOLOv8 with DeepSort tracking.
  - `Yolo_DeepSort_CameraGimbal.py`: Full pipeline with camera and gimbal control.
  - `DetectorDeepSort.py`, `TrackerDeepSort.py`: Detection and tracking modules.
  - `custom_botsort.yaml`: Custom configuration for tracking.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- NVIDIA Jetson device (e.g., Orin Nano, Xavier, TX2, etc.) with JetPack 6.2 (L4T 36.4.3) or compatible
- Docker installed for containerized setup
- 3D printer for two-axis components (optional, for hardware assembly)

### Installation

1. *(Optional but recommended)* Set up your NVIDIA Jetson device with an SSD for Docker with GPU acceleration. This improves performance and storage capacity.

2. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/E2504_bachelor.git
    cd E2504_bachelor
    ```

3. Build and run with Docker for NVIDIA Jetson platforms:
    ```sh
    chmod +x RunContainer.sh # Make script executable
    ./RunContainer.sh # This will pull and create a Docker environment
    ```
    
### Usage

- To run YOLOv8 detection:
    ```sh
    python Programfiles/Yolo.py
    ```
- To run detection and tracking:
    ```sh
    python Programfiles/Yolo_DeepSort.py
    ```
- For full camera and gimbal integration:
    ```sh
    python Programfiles/Yolo_DeepSort_CameraGimbal.py
    ```
